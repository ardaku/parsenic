//! #### A simple no-std I/O and parsing crate
//!
//! The main two traits for parsing are [`Read`] and [`Write`], implemented by
//! [`Reader`], which reads from a fixed-size slice of bytes, and [`Writer`],
//! which writes to a fixed-size slice of bytes.  The [`Read`] and [`Write`]
//! traits are designed to be extended with extension traits, using
//! [`traitful::extend#extend-a-trait`].
//!
//! Extension traits for big-endian an little-endian parsing are provided in
//! this crate as well; [`be::Read`], [`be::Write`], [`le::Read`],
//! [`le::Write`].  When importing a `Read` or `Write` extension trait, using
//! `as _` will help avoid namespace conflicts.
//!
//! # Synchronous and Asynchronous
//!
//! The [`Read`] and [`Write`] traits are synchronous by design.  This makes it
//! simple to read and write on in-memory data without touching I/O.  For I/O
//! bound reading and writing, there are the [`io::Source`] and
//! [`io::Destination`] traits which work by buffering the bytes to be sent on
//! an [`io::Sender`] or received on an [`io::Receiver`].
